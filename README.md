# COMP490P2
To create a simple web application using simple CGI interface.

1. Created gitHub.com public repository for COMP490P2
2. test.html is my first try of writing an html.
3. index.html works as the home page.
4. testRedirect.html is another html that shows a different page. This will be used to check if a link on the home page is working properly.
